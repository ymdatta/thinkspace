## Me ##

Hi, my name is Mohana Datta Yelugoti, and I'm currently a third-year undergrad
in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIITB](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). I
like tinkering around with programming, and occasionally writing useless
scripts.

Few areas I enjoy learning more about and working on (at least till now!):
Writing effective programs which are easy to understand and maintain and also
Computer Architecture.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/ymdatta). Feel free to contact
at ymdatta at gmail dot com.

## This Blog ##

I write this blog because I like to chant, rant and sometimes say things that I probably shan't.

<p>Hi, my name is Mohana Datta Yelugoti, and Iâ€™m currently a third-year undergrad
in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIITB</a>. I
like tinkering around with programming, and occasionally writing useless
scripts.</p>

<p>Few areas I enjoy learning more about and working on (at least till now!):
Writing effective programs which are easy to understand and maintain and also
Computer Architecture.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/ymdatta">Github</a>. Feel free to contact
at ymdatta at gmail dot com.</p>

<p>I write this blog because I like to chant, rant and sometimes say things that I probably shanâ€™t.</p>

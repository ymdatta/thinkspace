I"®<p>I am going to discuss about how i implemented Bag of Visual Words[1], to categorize
images using python, openCV and Scikit-learn.
You can find the code for it <a href="https://github.com/ymdatta/BagOfVisualWords">here.</a></p>

<p>Implementing BagOfVisualWords mainly involves these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extracting Features from Images.</li>
  <li>Getting Descriptors of features, which are used to represent the features.
    <ul>
      <li>Extracting features and generating descriptors for them can be done using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">SIFT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features">SURF</a> etc. I have used SIFT, as itâ€™s descriptor is a 128 dimension
vector, which means it holds a lot of information of the feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Constructing Vocabulary which contains visual words, which are nothing but
cluster centres.
    <ul>
      <li>To extract clusters, first we need data. I have used Caltech-101 dataset
for images. I randomly took 1000 images, extracted features of those 1000
images using SIFT. Now we have data, we need to extract cluster centres
for data. I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-Means Clustering</a> algorithm for this purpose. I ran the
K-Means clustering algorithm on the data(i.e features of images), which
seperated the data into various clusters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Representing each image as a feature vector.
    <ul>
      <li>For each image we extract the features, and say there are 100 clusters.
We create a feature vector of shape 1X100, and set all values of vector to 0.
Now for each feature of the image, we check which cluster center it is
nearest to, and say if it is nearest to 88th cluster center, we increase
the value of 88th index in the feature vector by 1. In the end, we get
a feature vector, which represents the image.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Training Classifier using feature Vectors of Images and their labels,
 and then predicting the labels of feature Vectors of Unknown Images.
    <ul>
      <li>Now, i have created a training and testing data-set using Caltech101.
The training-testing ratio is 80-20. i.e, i am extracting the feature Vectors
of all the 100 images in the dataset, but i am showing labels only for 80
images and asking the classifier to predict for other 20 images.I have used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">SVM</a> of Scikit library
for classification purpose.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Please check the results folder for the confusion matrices obtained.
ex: confusion matrix of 5 categories with 600 clusters.

<p>i have included doc-strings for each function in the <a href="https://github.com/ymdatta/BagOfVisualWords">code</a>, which
  can help in understanding the code.</p>
